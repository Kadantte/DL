# Authentication

After you have downloaded the latest release the first thing to do is to fill out the `auth.json` file.

## Browser Extension

You can use a browser extension to help get the required info for the `auth.json` file. The extension supports Google Chrome and Firefox and can be found [here](https://github.com/whimsical-c4lic0/OF-DL-Auth-Helper/) (https://github.com/whimsical-c4lic0/OF-DL-Auth-Helper/).

## Manual Method

Open `auth.json` in a text editor of your choice. The default windows notepad is sufficient. When you open `auth.json` for the first time you should see something like this:

```json
{
    "USER_ID": "",
    "USER_AGENT": "",
    "X_BC": "",
    "COOKIE": ""
}
```

Next, log into OnlyFans, and press F12 to open the dev tools. In the filter box, type `api`, and open any page on OnlyFans (e.g. Messages). You should see some requests appear in the list within the network tab:

Click on one of the requests you see in the list, and scroll down until you find the 'Request Headers' section.

You should be able to find the 3 fields we need, `Cookie`, `User-Agent` and `x-bc`.

Within Cookie you will find 2 bits of information that we need to copy, these being `sess` and `auth_id`.

So heading back to your text editor:

The value of `USER_ID` will be set to what `auth_id` is set to.

The value of `USER_AGENT` will be set to what the `User-Agent` is set to in the Request Headers.

The value of `X_BC` will be set to what the `X-Bc` is set to in the Request Headers.

The value of `COOKIE` will be set to `auth_id=YOUR AUTH_ID HERE; sess=YOUR SESS HERE;`, please make sure you copy the values from within the Cookie field found in the Request Headers section.

If you have done everything correct you should end up with something like this (this is all dummy info):

```json
{
  "USER_ID": "123456",
  "USER_AGENT": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:121.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/121.0",
  "X_BC": "2a9b28a68e7c03a9f0d3b98c28d70e8105e1f1df",
  "COOKIE": "auth_id=123456; sess=k3s9tnzdc8vt2h47ljxpmwqy5r;"
}
```
